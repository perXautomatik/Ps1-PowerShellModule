compare each file to eachother and put ressult in a hashtable then put that hashtable in another hashtable.
or add ressult as a object to the side of the inithal pathtable, feels rather pipelike somehow
each file has json like structure
make sure comparrision is done on the data structured

compare both with =>, <=, = comparission and and "differing lines"

for each path
    compare with each path
        when path != path
            add ressult to table.

for each table in path ressult list
    sort by similarity, where most similar is in the middle the files that is seen as "larger" than the initial file is to the very topp and the files that are seen as "smaller" than the initial file is in the button
    arrange the initial list entry so that each entriy is bellow the files that are seen as larger than it
    and above files that are seen as smallar than it.

    could cause a endless loop so the algorithm may only do x number of corrections.
    a correction is basicly running over each entry and see if they
